'''* NAME: smbPitchShift.cpp
'''* VERSION: 1.2
'''* HOME URL: http://www.dspdimension.com
'''* KNOWN BUGS: none
'''*
'''* SYNOPSIS: Routine for doing pitch shifting while maintaining
'''* duration using the Short Time Fourier Transform.
'''*
'''* DESCRIPTION: The routine takes a pitchShift factor value which is between 0.5
'''* (one octave down) and 2. (one octave up). A value of exactly 1 does not change
'''* the pitch. numSampsToProcess tells the routine how many samples in indata[0...
'''* numSampsToProcess-1] should be pitch shifted and moved to outdata[0 ...
'''* numSampsToProcess-1]. The two buffers can be identical (ie. it can process the
'''* data in-place). fftFrameSize defines the FFT frame size used for the
'''* processing. Typical values are 1024, 2048 and 4096. It may be any value <=
'''* MAX_FRAME_LENGTH but it MUST be a power of 2. osamp is the STFT
'''* oversampling factor which also determines the overlap between adjacent STFT
'''* frames. It should at least be 4 for moderate scaling ratios. A value of 32 is
'''* recommended for best quality. sampleRate takes the sample rate for the signal 
'''* in unit Hz, ie. 44100 for 44.1 kHz audio. The data passed to the routine in 
'''* indata[] should be in the range [-1.0, 1.0), which is also the output range 
'''* for the data, make sure you scale the data accordingly (for 16bit signed integers
'''* you would have to divide (and multiply) by 32768).

'            must be a power of 2. It expects a complex input signal (see footnote 2),
