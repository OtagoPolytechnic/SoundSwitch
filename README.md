# SoundSwitch

## About
This program is an accessibility tool, intended for those with diminished motor
control - typically those users also rely on the usage of eye-tracking software
and hardware, which this program functions in tandem with.

This program was developed as a senior project for part of the Bachelor of
Information Technology at Otago Polytechnic.

## Why?
Accessibility software can be prohibitively expensive and still suffer from
the downside of being slow to operate. This code offers an free, open-source, and quick
alternative to costly voice recognition & macro software.

## Installation
To build this software on your computer, you will require the following:

* A valid installation of Visual Studio 2013 or greater.
* A microphone. Higher quality microphones will yield more accurate results.

If you do not wish to alter the code or build it yourself, we have provided
pre-built .exe files that work with windows. (link to releases section here)

# Built With
* nAudio - Audio capture software (for use when saving recorded sounds).
* scape-xcorrsound - Library that facilitated the generation of comparison values
between .wav files.
