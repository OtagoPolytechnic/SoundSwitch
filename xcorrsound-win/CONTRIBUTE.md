* https://github.com/openplanets/scape-xcorrsound
* https://travis-ci.org/openplanets/scape-xcorrsound

### Requirements

To build you require:

* C++
* cmake

The tools depend on FFTW3 and Boost program options. These can be found as debian packages.
And as rpm packages. On Mac OS X the dependencies can be installed using Homebrew (http://brew.sh).
To build you also need ronn / ruby-ronn / rubygem-ronn

Preparations Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev libboost-all-dev ruby-ronn

Preparations Centos/Fedora:

    sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ glibc boost-devel fftw-devel rubygem-ronn

Preparations Mac OS X run

    brew install boost
    brew install fftw
    brew install ronn ??? NOT TESTED

### Build

To build the xcorrSound tool suite follow these steps:
Download the repository, change directory to the repository and run:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

You will now find all the tools in build/apps/

### Build Debian Package

Inside the build directory run:

    cpack -G DEB

Now the .deb package file is in the build directory.
To install

    sudo dpkg -i scape-xcorrsound*deb
